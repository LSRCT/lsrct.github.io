## Hi!
I love building tech products, working with excellent teams and giving cool ideas the hype they deserve.
Programming and tech has been my passion for more than 10 years.


After exploring computer vision for 3 years as an ML Engineer I went to to found a startup, GoatSwitch AI.

In my year as a founder I learned more than I thought possible and fell in love with the vibe of the startup community.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about tech, AI or startups!
